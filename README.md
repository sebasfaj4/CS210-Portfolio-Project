# CS210-Portfolio-Project

Project Summary
This project is a C++ program that simulates a digital clock. It displays time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats and allows the user to increment the hours, minutes, or seconds through a simple menu. It solves the problem of manually managing time changes and demonstrates how to create a dynamic, real-time system.

What I Did Well
I did a great job organizing the code into multiple files (Clock.h, clock.cpp, and main.cpp), which made the project clean and easy to understand. I also included helpful comments and followed good coding practices, making the program user-friendly and readable.

Areas for Improvement
One area for improvement would be adding stronger input validation to prevent users from entering invalid options. Adding these checks would make the program more robust, prevent unexpected crashes, and improve the overall security of the code.

Challenges and Solutions
Handling the rollover of time (like resetting seconds to 0 after reaching 60 and incrementing minutes) was tricky. I solved this by carefully designing the increment functions and testing many different scenarios. I also looked up examples online about clock systems to understand the best way to structure my logic.

Transferable Skills
Through this project, I improved my skills in modular programming, time formatting, user input handling, and working with classes in C++. These skills will transfer well into other programming projects, especially ones that involve real-world simulations or require organizing code into multiple files.

Code Quality
I kept the program maintainable and readable by using clear variable names, consistent formatting, and breaking the code into separate files. I wrote comments to explain key parts of the logic and designed the clock system to be easily adaptable if more features, like an alarm or timer, were added later.
